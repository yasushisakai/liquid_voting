liquid voting module

example:

alice, bob, and carol are the voters, p1 and p2 are
direct policies.

|    | alice | bob | carol |
| a  |  0.0  | 0.2 |  0.3  |
| b  |  0.5  | 0.0 |  0.1  | 
| c  |  0.1  | 0.4 |  0.0  |
| p1 |  0.0  | 0.3 |  0.6  |
| p2 |  0.4  | 0.1 |  0.0  |

how you read this matrix is like this:

alice voted for bob 0.5 votes, 0.1 for carol, and 0.4 for p2.
bob voted to alice 0.2, 0.4 votes for carol, and 0.3 for p1 and 0.1 for p2. and
so on. Note that the total for each voter is 1.0.

we need a json file that looks like this,

[
[0.0, 0.2, 0.3],
[0.5, 0.0, 0.1],
[0.1, 0.4, 0.0],
[0.0, 0.3, 0.6],
[0.4, 0.1, 0.0]
]

this will give a result like this:

[1.9414062500000009, 1.0585937500000002]
[4.333333333333335, 4.762376237623764, 6.454545454545452]

this means that p1 had approx. 1.9 votes, where p2 had 1.05 and Carol was most
influential for this poll.
